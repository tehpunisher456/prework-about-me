      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hey I'm new to coding, but I am hoping I can learn so I can get on a better career path.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Born and raised in LA.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>At the moment I love spending time with my daughter, she means the world to me. I also like my reef tanks, I have two, one dedicated to coral and the other dedicated to anemones.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I wouldn't say I have a dream job per se, I just want a career change and hopefully this will give me exactly that.
      </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Los Angeles at the moment</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Like I've said above, I want a better career path. The one I am in right now is tough and there is money there, but it just isn't for me.</p>
